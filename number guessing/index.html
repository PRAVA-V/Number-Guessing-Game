            <h1>How to Play the Number Guessing Game:</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Objective: The goal of the game is to guess the correct number between 1 and 100.</li>
                <li>Making a Guess:
                    Enter your guess in the input field. Make sure your guess is a number between 1 and 100.
                    Click the "Submit" button to submit your guess.</li>
                <li>Getting Feedback:

                    After submitting your guess, you'll receive feedback in the form of a message.
                    If your guess is correct, the message will congratulate you and display the number of attempts it
                    took.
                    If your guess is too high, the message will suggest trying a lower number.
                    If your guess is too low, the message will suggest trying a higher number.</li>
                <li>Playing Again:
                    If you want to play again, simply make a new guess after receiving feedback.
                    The game will continue until you correctly guess the number.</li>
                <li>Game Over:

                    Once you guess the correct number, the game will announce your victory.</li>
            </ul>
